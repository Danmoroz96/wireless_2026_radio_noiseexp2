# wireless_2026_radio_noiseexp2
Objective: To simulate the process of adding and removing noise from a signal using MATLAB.  This experiment provides hands-on experience with adding noise to a signal, visualizing the effects, and implementing a simple noise removal technique using a low-pass filter.
